            Mmm hmm
            Yeah, yeah

            Holy diver
            You've been down too long in the midnight sea
            Oh, what's becoming of me?
            Ride the tiger
            You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
            Oh, don't you see what I mean?

            Gotta get away
            Holy diver, yeah

            Got shiny diamonds
            Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
            Something is coming for you, look out
            Race for the morning
            You can hide in the sun 'til you see the light
            Oh, we will pray it's alright

            Gotta get away, get away

            Between the velvet lies
            There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
            The vision never dies
            Life's a never ending wheel, say

            Holy diver
            You're the star of the masquerade
            No need to look so afraid, jump, jump
            Jump on the tiger
            You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
            Some light can never be seen, yeah

            Holy diver
            You've been down too long in the midnight sea
            Oh, what's becoming of me? No, no
            Ride the tiger
            You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
            Oh, don't you see what I mean?

            Gotta get away, get away
            Gotta get away, get away, yeah

            Holy diver, sole survivor
            You're the one who's clean
            Holy diver, holy diver
            There's a cat in the blue
            Coming after you, holy diver
            Oh, holy diver, yeah, alright

            Get away, get away, get away
            Holy diver, holy diver, oh holy diver, oh ooh
